# Usage 

This Jupyter notebook usues machine learning to predict the Open High Low Close and Volume (OHLCV) of a particular stock
The first model is an SVC model and the second is a DecisionTreeClassifier

The first model has the result of 
![SVC_plot](https://github.com/EthernetWink/Module_14_Colmbia_Challenge/assets/91394235/028eb5fd-e91d-4118-9417-5c2e12003348)




The second

What is interesting is these two different models yeild very similar results.
